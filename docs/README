HSTCAL
======
HSTCAL is a C-based package which is comprised of the science calibration
software in support of the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS), Space Telescope
Imaging Spectrograph (STIS), and Wide Field Camera 3 pipelines. Initially, the
pipelines were written using C, but were encapsulated within the IRAF/STSDAS
environment, relying on IRAF to perform I/O and other basic interface
functions. HSTCAL replaces all the IRAF-based functionality with routines
based on the third-party package CFITSIO.  This allows all the pipeline
software to be compiled and run without any dependence on IRAF.  Not only
can HST data be processed using the C code directly via the C executables,
but the pipelines can also run by using a high-level Python interface.  The
Python interface scripts are thin wrappers for the C executables.

Detailed documentation for each instrument's calibration processing code can currently be found in the following locations:
